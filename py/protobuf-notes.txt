pip install protobuf

     from google.protobuf.internal import api_implementation
     print(api_implementation.Type())
     if it says "upb", that's the fastest implementation.

upb seems to have a memory leak tho, if you find where it's installed
(named _upb under a google subdir) you can rename it to something else
and the python API will fall back to a python implementation which 
does not have a memory leak.
