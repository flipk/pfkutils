- create flat array of X file paths, indexed [0,X-1]
- create Y threads
- each thread:
   1- generate random number N in [0,X-1]
   2- if file path [N] is in use, go back to 1
   3- mark file path [N] as in-use (mutex protected)
   4- if this file does not exist
      41- create it, generate random seed, generate random contents
      42- save seed in file path obj, mark file as existing
   5- if file does exist
      51- open it, reinit random seed, read contents, verify
      52- generate random [0,99], if >50 delete file and mark as gone
   6- mark it as not-in-use, go back to 1
