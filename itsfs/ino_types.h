/*
 * This code is originally written by Phillip F Knaack.
 * There are absolutely no restrictions on the use of this code.  It is
 * NOT GPL!  If you use this code in a product, you do NOT have to release
 * your alterations, nor do you have to acknowledge in any way that you
 * are using this software.
 * The only thing I ask is this: do not claim you wrote it.  My name
 * should appear in this file forever as the original author, and every
 * person who modifies this file after me should also place their names
 * in this file (so those that follow know who broke what).
 * This restriction is not enforced in any way by any license terms, it
 * is merely a personal request from me to you.  If you wanted, you could
 * even completely remove this entire comment and place a new one with your
 * company's confidential proprietary license on it-- but if you are a good
 * internet citizen, you will comply with my request out of the goodness
 * of your heart.
 * If you do use this code and you make a buttload of money off of it,
 * I would appreciate a little kickback-- but again this is a personal
 * request and is not required by any licensing of this code.  (Of course
 * in the offchance that anyone every actually DOES make a lot of money 
 * using this code, I know I'm going to regret that statement, but at
 * this point in time it feels like the right thing to say.)
