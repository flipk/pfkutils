/*
 * You know, when you have a program that does something really cool, and
 * you wrote it from scratch, and it took a significant part of your
 * life, you grow fond of it. When it's finished, it feels like some kind
 * of amorphous sculpture that you've created. It has an abstract shape
 * in your head that's completely independent of its actual
 * purpose. Elegant, simple, beautiful.
 *
 * Then, only a year later, after making dozens of pragmatic alterations
 * to suit the people who use it, not only has your Venus-de-Milo lost
 * both arms, she also has a giraffe's head sticking out of her chest and
 * a cherubic penis that squirts colored water into a plastic bucket. The
 * romance has become so painful that each day you struggle with an
 * overwhelming urge to smash the fucking thing to pieces with a hammer.
