websocket-demo
==============

This code is for demo purposes only. It shows how to work a websocket.

There's a C++ component (WebSocketServer) for the server side.  It
handles accepting new connections, spawning threads to handle them,
and the parsing and generating of websocket packets.  There's a
javascript component for passing these messages back and forth.

Google Protobufs are used for all encoding and decoding.  Protobufs
(C++) are available from code.google.com/p/protobuf.  There is also a
javascript implementation which came from
github.com/sirikata/protojs.git.

The messages are defined in pfkchat.pbj.  protojs was used to
autogenerate pfkchat.pbj.js for the client side, and 'protoc' from
protobuf-2.5.0 was used to generate pfkchat.pbj.pb.cc and .h on the
server side.  Both the protojs and protobuf messages use the same wire
format so they understand each other nicely.

I haven't figured out how to send pure binary messages.  What I'm
sending is base64 encoded protobuf messages.  protojs has very, very
little documentation, and what I did was based on a very short piece
of sample code which did base64. It seems to be pretty efficient,
though I'd hope a pure binary implementation would be moreso.


WARNING
=======

This code is NOT production quality! It is so full of holes you could
drive a nigerian scammer through it. Do not deploy on a production
server!  You will be screwed so hard! I warned you.
