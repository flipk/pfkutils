ENC TEL GATE PROXY + ENC TEL GATE WORKER
----------------------------------------

- create adm hookup listening tcp port 
- when connection received
   - create 'user' adm gate port
   - create 'network' adm gate port
      - create packet encoder and decoder.
- user and network exchange raw data; all raw data passes
  through packet_decoder filter.
- if packet_decoder finds a packet, pipeno is examined; pipe manager
  in pipe mgr array indexed by pipeno is given this packet.



PROTOCOL
--------
the protocol exhanged between the worker and proxy is as
follows. packets may be up to 1600 bytes long.  Packets are base64
encoded with a meaningless newline inserted every 72 characters.

A packet begins with the 4 character sequence "PFK1".
What follows is a sequence of N 4-character base64-encoded characters.
Each 4-character group translates into three bytes.
Every 72 characters, a newline is inserted.
The packet contains the following data:
	- two-byte big-endian packet length value (len)
	- (len) bytes of packet data.
	- two-byte big-endian checksum value
		- note the checksum is calculated over only the data bytes
The packet decoder acts as a filter, removing every character
sequence recognized as a packet and passing through every character
which is not part of a packet.
