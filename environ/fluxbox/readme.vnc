the following things are different for the .VNC version:

init:
the keyFile and menuFile entries point to different files
on the dual-monitor system, session.screen0.toolbar.onhead
points to monitor 2.

keys:
in many places, use mod4 (WIN) instead of mod1 (ALT) so that
a vnc session can be nested but window move/resize still works.

menu:
the 'resolution change' menu exists in vnc but not on hardware.
also, vncviewer to 127.1:0
