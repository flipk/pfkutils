 - threads code needs dll2 in timer lists
 - threads code needs dll2 in message lists ? or msg queue lists
 - threads messages tcp, i've learned that async connect can be known
   to complete by a successful select-for-write on the socket; review
   code to see if that will help.
 - ipipe.c should roll up into tcpgate.C
 - itsfs needs a remote inode worker that is much more efficient
 - itsfs needs a cache tree to sit in front of the remote inode trees
 - try writing a threads version of tcpgate.C
