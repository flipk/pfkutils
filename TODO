autoconf:
  - syslog ini files
  - autoconfize pfkstat
  - autoconfize treescan
  - d3des implementation duplication (util & etg)
  - runemacs (optional)
  - runrxvt (optional)

threads:
 - implement external tcp messaging in threads
   - messages based on BST framework
   - base type
     - magic / length / type / checksum
     - method for encoding to fd
   - object or thread which gateways fd Rx data to
     callback/handler methods.
     - perhaps a base class which accepts buffers of
       received data, and which calls virtual derived methods
       to handle the received & decoded messages.
     - if it can be tied into PK_Message_Manager, that would
       be best, to allow design of message-based main loops which
       include remote TCP messages in its event processing.
   - perhaps a connection manager object which has standard defined
     messages for indicating connection established & connection lost,
     as well as requests for establishing outgoing connections.
   - perhaps support TCP & UDP as well.
