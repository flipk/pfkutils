 - btree needs to delete blocks from cache if they've been
   there for a while.
 - a 'close' command to itsfs needs to delete keys from the database
   for that mount in a backgrounded way
 - itsfs needs a cache tree to sit in front of the remote inode trees
 - why does 'tar zxf somefile.tar' in a remotely mounted tree sometimes
   produce garbage files?
