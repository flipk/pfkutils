autoconf:
  - autoconfize pfkstat
  - d3des implementation duplication (util & etg)

threads:
 - implement external tcp messaging in threads
   - perhaps a connection manager object which has standard defined
     messages for indicating connection established & connection lost,
     as well as requests for establishing outgoing connections.
   - perhaps support TCP & UDP as well.
