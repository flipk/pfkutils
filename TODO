 - itsfs needs a control command

 - pkstgen needs input A,B,C { ... } syntax
 - pkstgen needs input * { ... } syntax
   (document difference!)

 - itsfs needs a cache tree to sit in front of the remote inode trees
 - why does 'tar zxf somefile.tar' in a remotely mounted tree sometimes
   produce garbage files?
