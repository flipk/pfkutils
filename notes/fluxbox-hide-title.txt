to get id of a window, put your mouse in that window, then:

xprop -root | grep _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW

xprop -id $id

xprop -id $id -f _MOTIF_WM_HINTS 32c -set _MOTIF_WM_HINTS "0,0,0"

first word, value "2" is bit for decorations present.
decorations are third word.
in third word, "1" means "all", don't turn that on.
"8" means title.

turn on all decorations:

xprop -id 0xc005dd -f _MOTIF_WM_HINTS 32c -set _MOTIF_WM_HINTS "2,0,254"

turn off title bar:

xprop -id 0xc005dd -f _MOTIF_WM_HINTS 32c -set _MOTIF_WM_HINTS "2,0,246"

note that fluxbox doesn't modify anything if first word is 0.

also note fluxbox has another way to modify titlebar :

	keys : Mod1 F12 :ToggleDecor

hit alt-F12 and it will toggle decorations.
