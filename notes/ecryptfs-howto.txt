first time:
ecryptfs-setup-private

to mount:
ecryptfs-mount-private

to unmount:
ecryptfs-umount-private

Files in ~/Private/
Storage in ~/.Private/
Setup files in ~/.ecryptfs/

Note ~/.ecryptfs/auto-mount and auto-umount can be touched or removed
to cause automounting during login/logout (done by a PAM plugin i guess)

--------------------

create the directories
e.g. mount point:  /home/user/project/
The backing store: /home/user/.ecryptfs.project/

the first time you run this it will ask a bunch of questions:

sudo mount -t ecryptfs /home/user/.ecryptfs.project/ /home/user/project/

When it mounts, it will print option values.  Turn them into a command
for the next time you mount (and save this somewhere!):

sudo mount -t ecryptfs -o \
ecryptfs_unlink_sigs,\
ecryptfs_passthrough=n,\
ecryptfs_fnek_sig=<HEX NUMBER>,\
ecryptfs_key_bytes=32,\
ecryptfs_cipher=aes,\
ecryptfs_sig=<HEX BYTES> \
/path/to/store  /path/to/mountpoint

when done:
sudo umount /home/user/project/
