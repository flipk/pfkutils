why does rxvt fail to build on ubuntu 14.04.5 ?
  something about ::setlocale not being defined
  i fixed this by commenting out HAVE_XSETLOCALE in config.h?
  i think my objdir isn't working, looks like it might be getting
  config.h from the source dir, not the obj dir -- i bet on 
  ub14 the objdir config.h undefs HAVE_XSETLOCALE and that's 
  why this is happening.
