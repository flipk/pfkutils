(setq custom-file (concat (getenv "HOME") "/pfk/etc/emacs/emacs-custom.el"))
(load custom-file)
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)


then, M-x list-packages
and type 'i' next to every package you want. type 'x' to install them.

package list :
  counsel git-gutter git-timemachine ivy protobuf-mode swiper xcscope magit-lfs magit

(note this is listed in "package-selected-packages" in emacs-custom.el)

note that packages get installed into ~/emacs.d/elpa/

i think emacs must reference this directory automatically on startup because i don't have
to do (require) anymore to access things like ivy-mode.

transferring the ~/emacs.d/elpa/ directory from one computer to another appears
to successfully transport installed packages.
