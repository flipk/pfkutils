on older versions, "xset m 0 0" does what you want. on later versions
it does not, definitely not.

ubuntu 18:
  dconf-editor
  go to org/gnome/desktop/peripherals/mouse
    and set the profile to 'flat' and speed to -1

or:
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse accel-profile flat
  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.mouse speed -1
