scenario:

reboot a linux server
when it comes back up, it's a different IP address!
ping <hostname> in WSL goes to old IP and doesn't work.
open powershell, nslookup <hostname> returns new IP.
close and restart WSL shell, it gets new IP and works.
attempt to connect to host using VNCViewer, it uses old IP!
in powershell: C:\> ipconfig /flushdns
repeat attempt with VNCViewer : it succeeds.

dafuq, ms?
