wsl 1 works better than 2 for ip address and drives

but wsl 2 works better for running a true linux kernel / mdcrypt, faster
filesystem, and NFS support (no NFS in WSL 1).

using VcXsrv (later version of Xming!)
just do "xset +fp H:\fonts" or whatever, and it should work

using Xming
edit font-dirs in Program Files (x86)/Xming
to include H:\apps\fonts\ which is pfkutils fonts
/etc/fstab:
H:\ /mnt/h drvfs defaults 0 0
P:\ /mnt/p drvfs defaults 0 0
L:\ /mnt/l drvfs defaults 0 0
