This is PFKSH.  It is based on pdksh-5.2.14.  That shell has not been
updated since June of 1999, so I decided to fork it.  I have also done
a great deal of cleanup.  Compilers and OSs have changed greatly since
1999.

- updated to recent automake

- quieted many compiler warnings (recent gcc hates some of those old
  coding styles, e.g. "if else if else if else" without curlies.  so
  many, many places with missing curlies....).

- strings passed to shf_vfprintf have chars interleaved with CHAR
  tokens.  oops. this was making 'jobs' output print like crap, every
  other char was a nonprintable garbage char.

- I have removed vi-mode because who the heck uses that.

- made x_cols resizing when we get TIOCGWINSZ.

- made many features mandatory that used to be optional (history, job
  control, emacs mode, ksh, edit, sharpbang, brace expand)

- removed useless ksh frontends to common unix apis (ksh_times, etc)

- remove useless 'register' keyword from all over the source

- ifdef HAVE_PROTOTYPES?  we've had that for decades.   DUP2_BROKEN?
  EEXIST?  EISDIR?  MEMMOVE BCOPY MEMSET LIONS TIGERS BEARS

- nobody gets unix-style mail anymore. removed /var/mail support.

- quite a few bits of code where 'if 0' because they didn't work or
  something?

- in many cases, undid K&R function prototypes

- I have removed a lot of code for very old platforms that no longer
  make sense (OS2, CRAY*, SYSV, SWTCH, CYGWIN, HPUX, MINIX, NeXT, SCO).
     - as a side comment, the OS2 support really screwed up
       a lot of crap.

- I have cleaned up emacs-mode.

- tab-completion can take ESC-number to autocomplete from numbered
  expansions output.

- and yes, KSH_VERSION says "PFK KSH v0.0.1" now... sorry.

TODO

( search for 'PFK BUG' in the source )

- make tab-completion understand filenames with spaces.

- xtree !!!  this could be really cool.

- "j_async: bad nzombie" is seen all the time on ubunutu 10
